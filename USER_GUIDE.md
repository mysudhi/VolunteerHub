## Features Guide

### Viewing Shifts

**What are shifts?**
Shifts are scheduled time blocks when volunteers are needed. Each shift has:
- A **title** describing the activity
- A **start and end time**
- A **location** (where to show up)
- A **capacity** (how many volunteers are needed)
- A **status** (Draft, Open, Filled, or Cancelled)

**Shift statuses explained:**

| Status | Meaning | What to do |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **DRAFT** | Shift is being planned, not yet visible to volunteers | Wait for admin to publish |
| **OPEN** | Shift is accepting volunteer signups | Sign up if interested! |
| **FILLED** | All spots have been taken | Check back later or look for other shifts |
| **CANCELLED** | Shift has been cancelled | No action needed |

---

### Managing Shifts (Admin)

As an OrgAdmin, you can create and manage shifts:

1. **Create a shift** — Set the title, description, time, location, and capacity
2. **Set required skills** — Specify what competencies volunteers need
3. **Publish the shift** — Change status from DRAFT to OPEN so volunteers can see it
4. **Monitor signups** — Track how many volunteers have signed up
5. **Cancel if needed** — Mark a shift as CANCELLED if plans change

---

### Signing Up for Shifts (Volunteer)

As a volunteer:

1. Browse available shifts on the **Shifts** page (or via the Dashboard)
2. Check the time, location, and required skills
3. Click to sign up for a shift
4. The shift appears on your **Schedule**
5. Show up at the designated time and location!

---

### Tasks Within Shifts

Shifts can be broken down into smaller tasks:

**What are tasks?**
Tasks are specific activities within a shift that can be assigned to individual volunteers. For example, a "Food Drive" shift might have tasks like:
- Set up tables (7:30 AM)
- Sort donations (8:00 AM)
- Distribute food (9:00 AM)
- Clean up (11:30 AM)

**Task statuses:**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **TODO** | Task hasn't been started yet |
| **IN_PROGRESS** | Someone is currently working on it |
| **DONE** | Task is complete |

---

### Skills and Matching

**What are skills?**
Skills are competencies that your organization defines. Examples:
- First Aid Certified
- Driver's License
- Food Handler's Permit
- Bilingual (Spanish)
- Heavy Lifting Capable

**How skills work:**
1. Admins define skills for the organization
2. Volunteers add skills to their profile
3. Admins can require specific skills for shifts
4. The system helps match qualified volunteers to appropriate shifts

---

### Calendar Events

ContributorHub includes a calendar system to help you visualize your schedule:

- **Internal events** — Created within ContributorHub, automatically linked to shifts
- **Imported events** — Synced from external calendars (iCal format) for a unified view

The calendar shows all-day events and timed events, making it easy to see your full schedule at a glance.
